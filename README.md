## Greetings 

I'm a 'hobbyist InfoSec' guy looking to get into the industry.

Years long ago I was involved in the VX scene producing PoC code. Creator of what are, to my knowledge, the first BlackBerry worm and Xbox malware (codes never released).

I've messed around to some extent in C, C#, Perl, PHP, and Python. Although assembler is where my heart is.

My ultimate goal is to move into a professional red team.
